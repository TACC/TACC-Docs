# TACC Account Status 

Account status is a state your account is in due to specific situations or factors. The following are the different account statuses that your account could be in:

* [Active](#active)
* [Pending Email Confirmation](#pendingemail)
* [Pending](#pending)
* [Deactivated](#deactivated)
* [Suspended](#suspended)

If you are having issues with your account, our [login support tool][TACCLOGINSUPPORT] is the fastest way to resolve any problems. You may also use it to simply check the status of your account. Your [user profile][TACCUSERPROFILE]  will also list the current status of your account (please note, both the login support tool and user profile are a part of the [TACC Accounts][TACCACCOUNTS] site, which is different from the [TACC User Portal][TACCUSERPORTAL]. Provided below is additional information about different account statuses, what they mean, and potential next steps.

New Users 

Note: can't have more than one TACC account per person.  

## Pending Email Confirmation

This is the state your account will be in when you have created your account for the first time. Once you submit your account request, you will receive an email with a link to confirm and activate your account. Until you click this link, your account status will be listed as `PendingEmailConfirmation`.
There is nothing wrong, and all you need to do is click the link you receive to confirm your account, after which your account status will change to either `Active` or `Pending`. If your account status turns to `Active`, you will now need to set up an MFA pairing for your account. You may refer to our MFA instructions page for information on how to set up your MFA. If your account turns into a `Pending` status after activation, please refer below for the next steps.
           
## Pending

If your account status becomes `Pending` after you submit your account request and click the confirmation link in your inbox, your account request will need to undergo further review by our team. You will receive an email from us with the results of the review.

If your account passed the review, your account status will turn to `Active` and you will be able to use your account once you set up an MFA pairing for your account. You may refer to our MFA instructions page for information on how to set up your MFA. If your account request is denied, there is unfortunately nothing else we can do and you will not be able to use TACC resources.

No action is required from you if your account status is `Pending`, but please do reach out to our help desk if you have any questions or concerns.

## Active

This is the normal state your account should usually be in. Please ensure that you have an MFA pairing associated with your account, you may refer to our MFA instructions page for information on how to set up your MFA. If you already have an MFA pairing associated with your account and you are not getting MFA tokens or your tokens are not working, you may need to unpair your existing MFA pairing and create a new one. If you are still facing any issues please reach out to our help desk for further assistance.

Active account holders may then log on to any *allocated* TACC resource.  Check allocations blah.

## Deactivated

This status occurs as a result of TACC's 120-day inactivity policy. If you have not used your account in 120 consecutive days, your account will automatically get deactivated per our security protocols. You can activate your account by logging into the TACC Accounts site (https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/activate) and requesting an activation link.

Once you have accepted TACC's acceptable usage policy, you will need to set up an MFA pairing for your account. Please note, even if your account previously had an MFA pairing, a deactivation will erase it on our end and you will have to set up a new one. You may refer to our MFA instructions page for information on how to set up your MFA.

## Suspended

Your account will show a `Suspended` status if your jobs or account usage is in violation of our usage policies and/or is causing harm to our systems. In a suspended state, you will not be able to use your account to log into our resources or run jobs. If you find your account in this state, please reach out to our help desk and a member of our team will walk you through what went wrong and what you will need to do in order to get your account unsuspended.

Regardless of what state your account is in, if you have any questions or concerns, you can always reach out to our help desk for assistance and a member of our team will be in touch with you.
