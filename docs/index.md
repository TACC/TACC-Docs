# Documentation Overview
*April 13, 2023*

**Welcome to TACC's Technical Documentation Site.**

Beyond the prefaced Essential Readings, TACC's technical documentation is broadly divided into three categories: High Performance Computing (HPC) User Guides, Software Packages at TACC, and Tutorials.  See Additional Training below for more TACC HPC training resources. 

All documentation is accessible via the left-hand navigation. 

If you're brand new to TACC and want to jump right in, check out the [Getting Started](tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/getting-started/) and [Allocations](https://dev.tup.tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/allocations/) pages in the "Use TACC" section of our [main site](tacc.utexas.edu).
