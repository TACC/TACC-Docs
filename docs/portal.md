# Portal Access

## Account Holders

If you already have an account, you may log in by clicking the "Log in" link at the top right of the Portal.

## Creating an Account

Before you can access the Portal, you must first have an active account with TACC.

If you are a new TACC user, please visit [TACC's Getting Started page](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/getting-started/) to learn how to create an account or request an allocation. Then you will need to return to this page for Portal access.

## Logging In for the First Time

Your initial login to the Portal begins an onboarding process.

When asked, click the Connect button.

### Requesting Access

To use the Portal, you may need to have an active allocation on TACC resources. If you are PI eligible, you may request your own allocations.

/// html | div.c-card--plain.c-card--image-top

//// html | img[alt="A sample Portal account onboarding with 'Requesting Access' step pending action."][src="imgs/portal/onboarding-access.userwait.png"]
////

If you are a new TACC user that does not have an active project, you may request to be added to one. Please click Request Portal Access in the Account Onboarding. A request to be added to an allocation will be generated on your behalf.

/// html | div.c-card--plain.c-card--image-top

//// html | img[alt="A sample Portal account onboarding with 'Requesting Access' step in progress."][src="imgs/portal/onboarding-access.staffwait.png"]
////

Your request will be reviewed by TACC staff. When you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail notification.

///
/// html | div.c-card--plain.c-card--image-top

//// html | img[alt="A sample Portal account onboarding with 'Requesting Access' step complete."][src="imgs/portal/onboarding-access.completed.png"]
////

Your account now has an allocation on the necessary TACC resources. You may proceed to the next step.

### Checking Project Membership

To use the Portal, you may need to have memebrship on a project. If you are PI eligible, you may request your own project. Alternatively, you may request to be added to a project through the Account Onboarding.

### Other Steps
