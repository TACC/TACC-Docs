## [Introduction to Lonestar6](#intro)

Lonestar6 provides a balanced set of resources to support simulation, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.  It is the next system in TACC's Lonestar series of high performance computing systems that are deployed specifically to support Texas researchers. Lonestar6 is funded through collaboration with TACC, the University of Texas System, Texas A&amp;M University, Texas Tech University, and the University of North Texas, as well as a number of research centers and faculty at UT-Austin, including the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering &amp; Sciences and the Center for Space Research.

The system employs Dell Servers with  AMD's highly performant Epyc Milan processor, Mellanox's HDR Infiniband technology, and 8 PB of BeeGFS based storage on Dell storage hardware.  Additionally, Lonestar6 supports GPU nodes utilizing NVIDIA's Ampere A100 GPUs to support machine learning workflows and other GPU-enabled applications.  Lonestar6 will continue to support the TACC HPC environment, providing numerical libraries, parallel applications, programming tools, and performance monitoring capabilities to the user community.
