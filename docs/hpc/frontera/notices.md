## Notices

!!!warning

	Frontera's `/scratch1` file system has developed persistent problems that have led to frequent system downtimes.  The `/scratch1` file system has now been mounted as a read-only file system and will be decommissioned on December 3rd.  (11-17-2025)

	You will need to migrate any wanted data in `/scratch1` to your [new Frontera scratch file system](#scratch-notice) immediately.  

	Going forward, users will have access to either the `/scratch2` or `/scratch3` file system, but not both.  See more [below](#scratch-notice).

<!-- * Users are limited to using one and only one of Frontera's `scratch` file systems. (10/22/2025) -->
<!-- 
* Navigate to the [Frontera Web Portal](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/) to manage your Frontera allocations and access your [Frontera Workbench](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/workbench/dashboard). (04/19/2023)
