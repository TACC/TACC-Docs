## [Status Updates and Notices](#notices) { #notices }

* **All users: refer to updated [Remote Desktop Access](#remote-desktop-access) instructions.** (07/21/2021)
* **New Queue: A new queue: `small` has been created specifically for one and two node jobs**. Jobs of one or two nodes that will run for up to 48 hours should be submitted to this new [`small` queue](#frontera-production-queues).  The `normal` queue now has a lower limit of three nodes for all jobs. These new limits will improve the turnaround time for all jobs in the `normal` and `small` queues. (03-30-21)
