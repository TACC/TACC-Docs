<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">**Stampede2 will reach end-of-life and will no longer be available as of November 30, 2023.  All queues and nodes will be decommissioned at this time**. </span> 

**Data Migration**: Please begin transferring your Stampede2 `/home` and `/scratch` directory contents to your preferred backup location.  Stampede2's `/work` file system and its contents will persist since it stands outside of Stampede2 on its own hardware. 

Please note that Stampede2 allocations will **not** automatically roll over to Stampede3.  You may apply for an allocation on the new Stampede3 system via the [ACCESS allocation process](http://allocations.access-ci.org).

Stampede2's `normal` and `development` queues are no longer available. The KNL nodes have been decommissioned. (07/15/2023)
