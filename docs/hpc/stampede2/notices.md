<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">**Stampede2 queues are now closed**</span>. The Stampede2 login nodes remain accessible so that you may continue to transfer data to Stampede3.  See the new [Stampede3 User Guide](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/stampede3)'s [Migrating Data](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/stampede3/#migrating) and [Allocations](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/stampede3/#intro-allocations) sections for further information.

Updated Timeline - Stampede2 to Stampede3 Transition.   
*All dates subject to change based on hardware availability and condition*.

January 2024 - Reduction in number of SKX/ICX nodes, reduction in queue maximums   
January 2024 - Stampede3 file system available for data migration  
February 2024 - Early user period for Stampede3  
February 2024 - Stampede2 file system decommissioned

**Data Migration**: Users must migrate their own data stored in `/home` and `/scratch` directory contents to your preferred backup location, such as your such as your own local hard drive or Ranch, by the end of **February 2024**.  Stampede2's `/work` file system and its contents will persist, since the hardware stands outside of Stampede2 on its own hardware, and will be mounted on Stampede3..  

**Existing Allocations**: Stampede2 allocations will **not** automatically roll over to Stampede3.  You may apply for an allocation on the new Stampede3 system via the [ACCESS allocation process](http://allocations.access-ci.org).  

**New Allocations**: You may now submit new allocation requests for Stampede3 via ACCESS: <https://allocations.access-ci.org>.

Additional allocation opportunities may also be available in the future
