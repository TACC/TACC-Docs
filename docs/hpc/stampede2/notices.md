<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">July 15, 2023 is the last day to submit to the Stampede2 `normal` and `development` queues. The SKX and ICX queues will remain open. (07/10/2023)</span>

**Stampede2 will reach end-of-life and will no longer be available as of November 30, 2023. Decommission will begin when the `normal` queue nodes with Intel's Knight's Landing (KNL) processors will no longer be available.  The rest of the system, the Skylake (SKX) and Ice Lake (ICX) nodes, will be retired at the end of November, 2023.**

**Stampede2's `/work` file system and its contents will continue to exist since it stands outside of Stampede2 on its own hardware. However, Stampede2's `/home` and `/scratch` file systems will be decommissioned along with the system.  We recommend transferring this data if it is still needed prior to decommissioning.**

**The new Stampede3 system will be available for allocation in November, 2023 via the [ACCESS allocation process](http://allocations.access-ci.org).**
