## NVIDIA Performance Libraries (NVPL) {nvpl}

The [NVIDIA Performance Libraries (NVPL)](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/) are a collection of high-performance mathematical libraries optimized for the NVIDIA Grace Armv9.0 architecture. These CPU-only libraries are for standard C and Fortran mathematical APIs allowing HPC applications to achieve maximum performance on the Grace platform. The collection includes:

### NVIDIA Documentation { nvpl-documentation }

* [NVPL BLAS Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/blas/index.html)
* [NVPL FFT Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/fft/index.html)
* [NVPL LAPACK Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/lapack/index.html)
* [NVPL RAND Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/rand/index.html)
* [NVPL ScaLAPACK Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/scalapack/index.html)
* [NVPL Sparse Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/sparse/index.html)
* [NVPL Tensor Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvpl/_static/tensor/index.html)

Consult the above documents for the details of each library and its API for building and linking codes. The libraries work with both NVHPC and GCC compilers, as well as their corresponding MPI wrappers. All libraries support the OpenMP runtime libraries. Refer to individual libraries documentation for details and API extensions supporting nested parallelism.

### Compiler Examples

**Example**: A compile/link process on Vista may look like the following:
This links the code against the NVPL FFT library using the GNU `g++` compiler. 
The features in NVPL FFT are still evolving, please pay close attention and follow the latest NVPL FFT document. 

```cmd-line
$ module load nvpl
$ g++ mycode.cpp -I$TACC_NVPL_DIR}/include \
		-L$TACC_NVPL_DIR}/lib \
		-lnvpl_fftw \
		-o myprogram
```

**Example**: This links the code against the NVPL OpenMP threaded BLAS, LAPACK, and SCALAPACK libraries of 32 bit integer interface using the NVHPC mpif90 wrapper. The cluster capability of BLAS from current NVPL release from NVHPC SDK-24.5 includes openmpi3,4,5 and mpich, choose the one that matches the MPI version in mpif90. 


```cmd-line
$ module load nvpl            
$ mpif90 -mp -I$TACC_NVPL_DIR}/include  \
       -L${TACC_NVPL_DIR}/lib   \
       -lnvpl_blas_lp64_gomp   \
       -lnvpl_lapack_lp64_gomp  \
      -lnvpl_blacs_lp64_openmpi5 \
      -lnvpl_scalapack_lp64   \
       mycode.f90
```


When linking using NVHPC compiler, convenient flags `-Mnvpl` and `-Mscalapackare` provided. As the behavior of these flags may change during active development, please refer to the latest <https://docs.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk//compilers/hpc-compilers-user-guide/index.html%23lib-use-lapack-blas-ffts>NVHPC compiler guide</a>for more details. 

### Using NVPL as BLAS/LAPACK with Third-Party Software

When your third-party software requires BLAS or LAPACK, we recommend that you use NVPL to supply this functionality. Replace generic instructions that include link options like -lblas or -llapack with the NVPL approach described above. Generally there is no need to download and install alternatives like OpenBLAS. However, since the NVPL is a relatively new math library suite targeting the aarch64, its interoperability to other softwares with a special 32 or 64 bit integer interface, or OpenMP runting support are not fully tested yet. If you have issues with NVPL and alternative BLAS, LAPACK libraries are needed, the OpenBLAS based ones are available as a part of NVHPC compiler libraries. 

### Controlling Threading in NVPL

All NVPL libraries support the both GCC and NVHPC OpenMP runtime libraries. See individual libraries documentation for details and API extensions supporting nested parallelism. NVPL Libraries do not explicitly link any particular OpenMP runtime, they rely on runtime loading of the OpenMP library as determined by the application and environment. Applications linked to NVPL should always use at runtime the same OpenMP distribution the application was compiled with. Mixing OpenMP distributions from compile-time to runtime may result in anomalous performance.  Please note that the default library linked with `-Mnvpl` flag is single threaded as of NVHPC 24.5, `-mpflag` is needed to linked with the threaded version. 
	

NVIDIA HPC modules provide a `libgomp.so` symlink to `libnvomp.so`. This symlink will be on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` if NVHPC environment modules are loaded. Use (<https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html>) <a https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html>ldd</a>to ensure that applications built with GCC do not accidentally load libgomp.sosymlink from HPC SDK due to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Use `libnvomp.soif` if and only if the application was built with NVHPC compilers.
	
`$OMP_NUM_THREADS` defaults to 1 on TACC systems. If you use the default value you will get no thread-based parallelism from NVPL. Setting the environment variable `$OMP_NUM_THREADS` to control the number of threads for optimal performance.
	

### Using NVPL with other MATLAB, PYTHON and R

TACC MATLAB, Python and R modules need BLAS and LAPACK and other math libraries for performance. How to use NVPL with them is under investigation. We will update.
