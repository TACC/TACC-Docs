## [Migrating Data](#migrating) { #migrating }

The Stampede3 login nodes are now available for you to begin moving data between systems.  **If you have an active Stampede3 allocation** then you may begin the data migration process from Stampede2 to Stampede3.  During this migration period Stampede2's `/home` and `/scratch` systems will be temporarily mounted on Stampede3 and will be accessible through the `$HOME_S2` and `$SCRATCH_S2` environment variables respectively.  

!!! warning
	The Stampede2 file mounts are temporary and will be removed once Stampede3 is in full production.

You do not need to migrate data from `$WORK` (Stockyard) as that file system will be automatically mounted on Stampede3.  However, anything in your `$HOME` or `$SCRATCH` directories that you wish to retain will need to be moved.  

!!! important
	Please migrate **only** the data you wish to keep from Stampede2.  

### [Examples](#migrating-examples) { #migrating-examples }

**If you have an active Stampede3 allocation** you can access Stampede3 via `ssh` as you do with other TACC resources.  Use the same password and MFA method as for accessing Stampede2.

``` cmd-line
ssh username@stampede3.tacc.utexas.edu
```
To move your data, we recommend using either the UNIX `cp` or `rsync` utilities.  

To copy a single file from Stampede2 to Stampede3: 

```cmd-line
stampede3$ cp $HOME_S2/filename $HOME
```
or

```cmd-line
stampede3$ rsync -r $HOME_S2/filename $HOME
```

To copy a directory: 

```cmd-line
stampede3$ rsync -r $SCRATCH_S2/dirName $SCRATCH
```
or

```cmd-line
stampede3$ cp -r $SCRATCH_S2/dirName $SCRATCH
```

!!! note
	Currently, there is no Globus endpoint on Stampede3.  We will make an announcement as soon as the endpoint becomes available.


## [Introduction](#intro) { #intro }

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has generously awarded the University of Texas at Austin funds for TACC's Stampede3 system ([Award Abstract # 2320757](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2320757)).  

### [Allocations](#intro-allocations) { #intro-allocations }

Submit all Stampede3 allocations requests through the NSF's [ACCESS](https://allocations.access-ci.org/) project. General information related to allocations, support and operations is available via the ACCESS website <http://access-ci.org>.

Requesting and managing allocations will require creating a username and password on this site. These credentials do not have to be the same as those used to access the TACC User Portal and TACC resources. Principal Investigators (PIs) and their allocation managers will be able to add/remove users to/from their allocations and submit requests to renew, supplement, extend, etc. their allocations. PIs attempting to manage an allocation via the [TACC User Portal](https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/dashboard) will be redirected to the ACCESS website.
