Principal Investigators can monitor allocation usage via the [TACC User Portal][TACCUSERPORTAL] under ["Allocations->Projects and Allocations"](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/projects-and-allocations). Be aware that the figures shown on the portal may lag behind the most recent usage.  Projects and allocation balances are also displayed upon command-line login.

<p class="portlet-msg-info">To display a summary of your TACC project balances and disk quotas at any time, execute:<br><br><code>login1$ <b>/usr/local/etc/taccinfo</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Generally more current than balances displayed on the portals.</code></p>
