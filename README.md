## Testing

- [A. Via Python](#a-via-python)
- [B. Via Docker](#b-via-docker)

### A. Via Python

0. Have Python installed.\
    <sup>Known supported versions are [from 3.10 to 3.12](https://github.com/TACC/TACC-Docs/blob/v0.10.1/pyproject.toml#L9).</sup>
1. Navigate into your clone of this repo.
2. Install dependencies:\
    <sup>You should only need to do this once, or after a new release.</sup>
    ```shell
    pip install poetry

    ```
3. Isolate dependencies:
    ```shell
    poetry shell

    ```
4. Update & Serve the docs:
    ```shell
    poetry install
    mkdocs serve

    ```
    <sup>After the `poetry shell` command, you should be in a Poetry-managed environment. Your prompt might be prefixed with the name of the environment.</sup>
5. Open the website _at the URL echoed by the program_ e.g.
    [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

### B. Via Docker

0. Have Docker installed.\
    <sup>We recommend doing so via [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).</sup>
1. Navigate into your clone of this repository.
2. Start the Docker container to serve the docs.
    ```shell
    make build
    make start

    ```
3. Open the website at the URL provided e.g.
    [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Automatic Builds

Automatic builds (not deploys) should occur on pushes to any branch.[^2]

## Automatic Deployment

Automatic deploys should occur after an automatic build on the `main` branch.[^2]

[^2]: To manually build or deploy, consult [our internal documentation](https://tacc-main.atlassian.net/wiki/x/aBhv).

## Releases

All commits to `main` will trigger a docker build and push a new image to `designsafeci/ds-user-guide:latest`.

A Watchtower service will monitor new pushes to this dockerhub repo and pull down new images _on the fly_ to [https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/).
